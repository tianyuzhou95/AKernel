# AKernel Standalone Deployment

This directory contains scripts and configurations for running AKernel in
standalone mode using Docker or Pouch, without Kubernetes. The deployment uses
two containers on the default container bridge:

- `akernel-node` runs the AKernel all-in-one image.
- `akernel-traefik` runs the official Traefik image as the external gateway.

Keeping the gateway in a separate network namespace allows sandboxd's normal
`PREROUTING` rules to handle gateway traffic. The all-in-one frontend sends
traffic from the node network namespace, so the standalone sandboxd config
also enables its local-output DNAT support.

The default runtime is gVisor `runsc`. `Sandbox(runtime="kata")` additionally requires `/dev/kvm` and hardware or nested virtualization on the Docker host. Nodes without KVM remain usable with runsc and do not advertise Kata to the scheduler.

Experimental NVIDIA GPU sandboxes use gVisor nvproxy. The host must provide a
compatible NVIDIA driver and NVIDIA Container Toolkit. Enable GPU access to
the node container with:

```bash
AKERNEL_ENABLE_GPU=true ./start.sh
```

The all-in-one image contains `nvidia-container-cli`, but not the host driver.
Use `AKERNEL_GPU_DEVICES` to override Docker's `--gpus` value when only a
device subset should be assigned.

Explicit sandbox storage quotas use the XFS filestore mounted at
`/home/akernel/xfs`. The standalone data directory is bind-mounted from the
host, and sandboxd creates `data/xfs.img` as a loop-backed XFS filesystem when
needed; quota-backed writable layers therefore use local disk rather than
tmpfs.

### Network backend

Standalone uses the iptables NAT backend by default. Nodes without the
required iptables NAT and conntrack kernel modules can select the experimental
embedded TC eBPF backend:

```bash
AKERNEL_NAT_BACKEND=bpfnat ./start.sh
```

The node container remains privileged. AKernel enables IPv4 forwarding before
sandboxd starts and disables global reverse-path filtering inside the node
network namespace when bpfnat local DNAT is enabled. bpfnat requires TC eBPF
and a writable bpffs. A custom host-network deployment whose `FORWARD` policy
is `DROP` must allow traffic to and from `sandbox0` with bridge- and
sandbox-CIDR-scoped rules.

AKernel passes YuanRong the IPv4 address of the default-route interface so the
later creation of `sandbox0` cannot change the advertised node address. Set
`AKERNEL_NODE_IP` only when a multi-homed deployment requires an explicit
override.

The standalone configuration enables per-sandbox network ACLs. In the default
iptables mode, `start.sh` loads `br_netfilter` on the host and sandboxd enables
bridge netfilter in the node network namespace; native conntrack supplies
stateful ACL and fragment handling. In bpfnat mode, the privileged node
container mounts bpffs and manages eBPF ACL, connection, and fragment state.
TCP and UDP port 53 on the sandbox bridge must remain free for sandboxd's
managed DNS proxy. Before upgrading an existing standalone data directory to
an ACL-enabled image, terminate its sandboxes and stop the old node cleanly;
sandboxd refuses to initialize ACLs while pre-ACL sandboxes remain in its
store.

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Authentication (as needed)

If you need to access private registries or OSS backends, edit the following configuration files to add your authentication credentials:

#### `config/oss_auths.json`
Update with your OSS credentials:
```json
{
  "your-oss-endpoint/your-oss-bucket": {
    "access_key_id": "your-access-key-id",
    "access_key_secret": "your-access-key-secret"
  }
}
```

#### `config/registry_auths.json`
Update with your registry credentials:
```json
{
  "auths": {
    "your-docker-registry": {
      "Auth": "base64-encoded-username:password"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Optional: Configure OSS and Registry Endpoints

Edit `config/oss.json` and `config/registry.json` to point to your actual OSS and registry endpoints.

### 3. Start AKernel

```bash
cd deploy/standalone
./start.sh
```

This will:
- Check prerequisites (Docker or Pouch availability)
- Create data directory
- Use `akerneldev/all-in-one:latest` if `IMAGE` is not set, reusing a local
  copy when present and otherwise pulling it from Docker Hub
- Start the privileged AKernel all-in-one container
- Start an independent Traefik container for the HTTPS API and HTTP sandbox
  port-forwarding gateway
- Configure Traefik to poll FunctionMaster's HTTP provider for per-sandbox
  tunnel routes, including custom tunnel ports
- Generate a deployment-specific IAM signing seed and a 24-hour SDK token
- Generate a sandboxd config using `AKERNEL_NAT_BACKEND` (`iptables` by
  default)
- Print the Traefik container IP to use as `AKERNEL_SERVER_ADDRESS`

No host ports are published. On Linux, the host accesses Traefik directly
through its Docker bridge IP.

### 4. Check Status

```bash
# View AKernel logs
sudo docker logs -f akernel-node

# View gateway logs
sudo docker logs -f akernel-traefik

# Enter the container
sudo docker exec -it akernel-node bash

# Check systemd services
sudo docker exec akernel-node systemctl status
```

**Note:** If using Pouch, replace `docker` with `pouch` in the commands above.

### 5. Stop AKernel

```bash
./stop.sh
```

## Customization

### SDK Connection

Traefik listens on port 443 for the AKernel API and port 80 for sandbox port
forwarding. These ports are not published on the host. Use the Traefik
container IP printed by `start.sh`, or retrieve it later:

```bash
TRAEFIK_IP=$(docker inspect \
  --format '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' \
  akernel-traefik)
```

Set the SDK environment:

```bash
export AKERNEL_SERVER_ADDRESS="${TRAEFIK_IP}"
export AKERNEL_TOKEN="$(cat data/token)"
```

The signing seed is stored in `data/iam-seed` and reused while that standalone
data directory exists. Delete the data directory to create a new deployment
identity. Set `STANDALONE_TOKEN_TTL` when starting AKernel to choose a different
token lifetime, for example `STANDALONE_TOKEN_TTL=7d ./start.sh`.

When `AKERNEL_SERVER_ADDRESS` contains only an IP address, the SDK uses HTTPS
port 443 for the API and HTTP port 80 for sandbox port forwarding. No separate
`AKERNEL_GATEWAY_ADDRESS` is required.

### Container Image Version

By default, `start.sh` uses the public Docker Hub image
`akerneldev/all-in-one:latest`. Override it with the `IMAGE` environment
variable to test another registry, tag, or locally built image:
```bash
IMAGE="<your-docker-registry>:<your-tag>" ./start.sh
```

The gateway defaults to `traefik:v3.6.8`. Override it independently when
needed:

```bash
TRAEFIK_IMAGE="traefik:v3.6.8" ./start.sh
```

### Data Directory Location

By default, data is stored in `./data`. To change this, edit `start.sh`:
```bash
DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/data"
```
